I am a JavaScript engineer living in Portland, Oregon. With over four years of developing in JavaScript I have gained experience with many frameworks/tools such as React, Backbone, AngularJS, Webpack, Node, Ionic/Cordova, and Electron. I always strive to create simple, readable, and maintainable code.

I mainly focus on the frontend in the React ecosystem with tools like Redux, Emotion, Webpack, and Babel, but I often write backend code with Node, Java, and Golang.
