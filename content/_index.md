My name is Wade Johnson and I am a Javascript developer. I love learning about and building projects with the latest technology. I mainly focus on frontend development where my tool of choice is React, but I also work with Node. A few things I'm currently exploring right now are React Native, ReactVR, and I've also been playing around with Go a little bit.
```javascript
if (1 == true) {
	console.log("I'm your man!");
}
```
